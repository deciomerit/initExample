Inside this zip is the Outlook compatible HTML email (index.html and images). This is now ready for you to queue up. Here are some instructions from the creative team:

STEP 1: Open a new blank composition window
STEP 2: File > Options > Quick Access Toolbar
STEP 3: Set the 'Choose Commands From' dropdown list to 'All Commands'
STEP 4: Navigate to "Attach File" and click add.
STEP 5: Click "OK" to confirm.
STEP 6: You will find the necessary Attach File option in a new composition window on the top ribbon. 


I found you need to use the attach option in the menu ribbon (paperclip), not the attach option in the email menu.

This option will present the option to Insert As Text


This feature needs to be enabled in Outlook 2016 as shown here:
